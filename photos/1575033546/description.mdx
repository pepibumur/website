We are traveling around the Basque Country to celebrate María José's birthday. We started in Bilbao, where this photos has been taken. The city is very beautiful and combines very well its modernism centuries of history. It goes without saying that the food here is damn delicious, in particular the pintxos, which is sort of like a tapa but most of the times with a stick in it.
