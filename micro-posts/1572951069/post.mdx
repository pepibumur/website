One of the terms that I'm trying to avoid lately is _scale_. I think is a _vague_ term that leaves you wondering what it means. It's like saying that something is good or bad. _Good in the eyes of who? Or bad in regards to what criteria?_ I'd rather talk in terms of problems and how to tackle them. In the context of software development, we can talk in terms of maintenance costs, interdependency between in code and between team, the testability or extensibility of the code. Those are more concrete examples that give the people that we talk to or the audience of our talks a better sense of what we are talking about.
