I am so happy to have the opportunity to meet so many great developers and human beings thanks to Tuist.
The lesson for me here is that even more important than writing the software of an open source project, is creating a healthy and welcoming culture that people can feel part of.
It's not Tuist's goal to reach the most number of starts on GitHub or users,
but rather build something useful from which all of us can learn from and that we can leverage to build bonds with other people in the industry.
