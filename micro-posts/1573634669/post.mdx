The [PR](https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj/pull/504) to add support for Linux to Tuist is coming along very well. The library is already compiling and running the tests in a Linux environment. There's just one more thing missing, listing all the tests in the `LinuxMain.swift`. Once we are done with it, the pull request should be ready to be merged.

What I find great about this new feature landing to the project is that developers will be able to build tools that can run in a Linux environment. The question that pops in my mind now is: does it make sense to support running Tuist on Linux?
