Most of my career I've invested a lot of time into open source, which is great from the altruistic point of view, but this morning I was pondering if it'd make sense to invest all that time into building useful products that I can sell to developers. At the end of the day, it's money what we need for living. Open source  has many positive things, but it also has frustrations and challenges that are tough to go through when it's your free time what you need for it.
