I decided that the name for the app that I plan to build to publish [Indie Social](https://indiesocia.io content),
[Bohemian](https://github.com/indiesocial/bohemian).
The reason why I picked that name is because I see the app being used by people that are unconventional,
that are not conformed with how capitalism has shapped our social interactions.

Moreover,
I also decided to use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) as a framework to build the app.
Shopify has commited to this framework and I would like to get more familiar with it.
Moreover,
I think it'll help get more contributions,
and share code between the iOS and the Android versions of the app.
