Last Saturday, we celebrated what I can consider one of the happiest days in my life, my wedding with María José. Being surrounded with family and friends from Spain and Berlin, all of us celebrating love together is something that I can't describe with words. I wanted to talk to everyone, telling them how happy I was to celebrate such important moment with them. María José was so beautiful. She made me feel very nervous when I saw her coming with her father.
