The world is complex,
and we developers model it with software.
The result of that is software that is complex too.
I believe Xcode is a good example of that.
It reflects the complexity of the platform;
a platform that went from one OS to many of then.

Many developers seem to be ok with that complexity.
I'm not.
I firmly believe simple software is far more enjoyable and crucial to developers' motivation than complex'.

That's why I like building Tuist.
Not because I want to build just another project generator,
but because I think Xcode developers need a simpler way to scale their projects.
