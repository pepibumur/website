My relationship with the social networks is a love & hate relationship. I'm again pondering the idea of giving up social networks. The reasons? Well... the same as always. I keep falling into the trap of seeking recognition and approval by the community and the people that follow my work. _What's wrong with that?_ That instead of doing things for the sake of being motivated, I do it to prove things or show off things to people, and I don't like having that attitude.
