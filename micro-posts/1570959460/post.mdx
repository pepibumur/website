What does working on paid product would mean for Tuist, a project some companies depend on and that I've been maintaining for the last 3 years? I'd still maintain it, but it will no longer be my main priority. I'll develop features that support my work and enable other developers to contribute to Tuist to support their projects too.

Tuist will be to my projects what Ruby on Rails is to Basecamp.
