One of the things that I'm struggling to become better at is not letting things around me make me feel outraged or angry. Why? Because anger and outrage are not worth my energy. Here are some recent examples:

- Wedding organization turning into a complete chaos a week before because our wedding planner hasn't organized the work well since we started working with her a few months ago.
- Comments on PRs that question everything but without proposing anything at all. Just inthe mood of that's bad, that other line too, what about this? How do you dare to do that?
