One of the things that I realized from being active in social networks like Twitter or in Slack communities where people are commenting every new thing that comes out is that my opinions end up being a conglomerate of everyone's opinion. I dislike not being myself and not spending time forming and wandering in my own thoughts an opinions.

This is one of the biggest motivations distance myself from communities and be an indie adventurer in the tech industry. It's hard because the itch is very strong when the feeling of connection doesn't exist but I believe is worth it.

I think part of the reason why I'm building creative ideas into Tuist is because I'm ignoring to some extend what has been done in the past or the things developers are used to.
