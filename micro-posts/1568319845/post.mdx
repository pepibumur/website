I added a micro blog section to my website using [this](https://github.com/tuist/gatsby-theme-micro-blog/blob/master/README.md) Gatsby theme that I developed for Tuist. _Why am I doing this when I could be publishing those posts on Twitter?_ I'll continue posting on Twitter, but I want to own the content that I share on the Internet. Twitter, like Facebook or Medium, might have a turn in their platform and put the content behind a wall.
