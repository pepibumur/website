The last days I've been working on [Angle](https://angle.dev), a macOS app that I'm developing with friends that eases and speeds up the process of trying out changes introduced to an iOS app. It's as easy as clicking a link, and the tool will make sure that the environment is ready to open it, and then launch it in a matter of seconds.

We are working on some final polishing to make sure the app works smoothly without bugs that impoverish the user experience. Can't wait to share more about it!
