I'm tired of the hypes on Twitter and what's worse, being part of them. Everyone seems, at least to my perception, to be in the lookout for the content that creates the most hype. That includes myself too.

What's the latest Xcode feature I can talk about and that no one has found yet? What's the open source microlibrary that I can create so that people have something to talk about even if I don't have interest in its active maintenance?

I think Internet has enabled taking our narcisist side to a whole new level.
