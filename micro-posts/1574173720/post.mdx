I finally found some time to write a blog post about [Tuist's 0.19.0 release](https://tuist.io/2019/11/19/version-0.19.0/). Besides a handful of minor improvements and fixes, it adds support for watch and sticker apps and extensions. My plan now is to focus on [Galaxy](/2019/11/18/module-caching-with-tuist/), a service that will take Tuist to a whole new level by providing cache and insight to Tuist's users. It's exciting times for the project!
