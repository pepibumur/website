In case anyone faces the need of having to compile a Swift Package with an stable ABI interface, passing the `-emit-module-interface` argument is not enough. Below there's an example of the command that we are using to compile Tuist's `ProjectDescription` framework:

```bash
swift build\
  --product ProjectDescription \
  --configuration release \
  -Xswiftc -enable-library-evolution \
  -Xswiftc -emit-module-interface \
  -Xswiftc -emit-module-interface-path \
  -Xswiftc .build/release/ProjectDescription.swiftinterface
```

With that generated `.swiftinterface`, consumers of the framework should be able to compile it with newer Swift versions.
