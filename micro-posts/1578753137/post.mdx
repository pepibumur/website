Just noticed that the latest version of Ruby,
2.7.0,
added support for a new operator that I've seen myself writing several times in the past:

```ruby
 ["a", "b", "c", "b"].tally
```

It counts the ocurrences of the elements in an array and returns a dictionary where the key is the element,
and the value is the number of times.

You can check out the changelog of 2.7.0 [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/25/ruby-2-7-0-released/).
