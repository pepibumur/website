I'm pondering again the idea of using my personal website as the source of truth for the content that I produce on the Internet. Unfortenately, every time I try, I end up falling back to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. I think the main reason is seaking recognition through likes and some other attention-driven features, and not having an app for iOS where I can post updates from. *Should I build one?*
