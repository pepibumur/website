I'm pondering the idea of cutting the first major releasse of Tuist. I feel we have already accomplished the first milestone that I set for the project, making the definition of projects easy and allowing reusing bits of the definitions. Over the last years we have validated the idea and the API, which has been very stable in the recent versions. From the version 1.0.0 I'll focus on building a service that leverages Tuist and its project generation feature.
