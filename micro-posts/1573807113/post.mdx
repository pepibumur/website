We are exploring the idea of adding an edit command to Tuist. The command would create and open a temporary Xcode project o edit your project. After finishing the edition, Tuist would prompt the user if they would like to generate the projects if changes have been detected.
I think is another step towards decoupling the generated projects from Tuist. The projects will have no knowledge about Tuist.
