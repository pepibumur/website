Just a few days ago I learned about the argument to generate Xcode projects from Swift packages that don't contain additional files:

```bash
swift package generate-xcodeproj --skip-extra-files
```

The generated Xcode project took a lot of time to open because it's a monorepo with other projects and I didn't know why. I'm very glad that I found it because Xcode was significantly slow indexing things.
