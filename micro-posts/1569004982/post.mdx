If there's one craft that I'd like to get better at, that's desining and implementing beautiful web interfaces. I look at interfaces like [GitHub](https://github.com/security), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), or [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-es) and I wonder what's needed to be there. I think all it takes is observations and imitation.
