Support for Watch apps [is coming along to Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/pull/623). Kas did a great job at extending the convenience of Tuist's DSL to the definition of watch apps too. He even implemented a check to ensure that the bundle identifier of the companion extension follows the right convention `{watchapp_bundle_id}.watchextension`.
