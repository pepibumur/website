I find very ironic that we, technologists with a privileged position in the world, show off out commitment for the climate change while:

- We keep consuming the latest of the latest in technology, the one that ends up polluting countries in Africa.
- We use the so-cool Uber scooters whose electric batteries will do all but good to this planet.
- We let companies create needs on us to buy things that might end up somewhere in our environment once we realize we don't really need them.

The change starts by leveraging our privileged position to lead by example, and not just bragging about us being part of the change while hiding our compulsive consumerism behind the curtains.
