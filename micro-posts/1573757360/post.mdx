It's great to see the ideas that I dream for to slowly become real. Today I just merged a PR into Tuist that makes the definition of projects just a one line. How cool is that? This is something that I always believed that Tuist would end up doing and here we are. It's simple, convenient, and most importantly, makes  extending projects a task in which everyone can participate.
