Today I just read [this blog post](https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-relies-on-people-working-for-free-a79104a68bcc) about Internet relying on the work that many people do in the open for free. Two thoughts pop in my mind:

- Wow. 20 years maintaining such a successful and robust project is remarkable. Nowadays, developers are seeking new projects frequently to keep feeding their need of recognition. I fall a bit in the latter group, but with Tuist I'm learning to put passion upfront and forget about the rest.
- It's really bad that most companies don't give back for the value that they receive from the tools that they use for free. cURL is an example, but certainly not the only one. It's great to see GitHub helping with sponsors, but we need to raise more awareness agains this unbalanced open source economy.
