A few years ago,
I called myself iOS developer.
I felt very comfortable with the platform and did not see myself developing for a platform other than iOS,
or a programming language other than Swift.
Things changed,
and nowadays I find myself doing frontend development,
developing command line tools,
and implementing a web API with Rails.
Not only that,
I also like designing the user interface of the software that I develop.
I learned that software is more than just writing some code,
putting it on a GitHub repository,
and creating some hype around it.
In order for users to love our craft, the software needs an identity and tell a story.
That's why I worked on designing an implementing a website for Tuist;
a website where we could share those stories with users.
We also worked on writing up documentation that helped users understand the motivations behind the tool,
and how to contribute to it if they are interested in doing so.
