There are reasons to blame Javascript for, but it upsets me a bit when I people affirm that websites are slow because of Javascript.
IMHO the problem here is not Javascript, but how it's used. If we bloat websites with heavy frameworks, or a tracking logic all over the place, it'll obviously be slow. It's ultimately how developers use the language and the framework to create experiences.
