I think one of the reasons why companies might move slower than what they could is because they have people that are excellent at one thing but that see other domains as areas to which they are not capable of contributing.

That's just a mental barrier that we are all imposing to us. We are engineers, and despite other domains feeling uncomfortable because we don't know them that much, we should push ourselves out of our comfort zone.

Personally, I've been doing that since I joined Shopify, and thanks to that I grew a lot. I've done Ruby, Rails, infrastructure, automation, Javascript, management... It's crazy the ideas that can come out of having a broad point of view and set of skills.
