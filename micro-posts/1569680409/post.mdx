I really like the process of defining abstractions to make things easier for developers.
Devising, and implementing such abstraction for iOS developers is what led me to build Tuist.
Developers keep comparing [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) with [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/xcodegen) saying that Tuist is a limited version of XcodeGen.

It shares with XcodeGen the project generation,
but those limitations are thoughtfully designed to make iOS developers life easier.
Instead of translating concepts from XcodeProj domain to a YAML domain,
Tuist takes the opportunity to simplify most intricacies,
leaving the user with a beautiful declarative API that defaults to some pre-defined conventions.

I'm looking forward to keep pushing the abstraction idea beyond project generation,
and a bit sad that I can't put more time into it.
If I just got Shopify to use it.
