I uninstalled work and social media related apps from my phone and I have no words to describe the peace that that creates in my mind. Interestingly, I’m more connected, but not with the world, with myself. I don’t feel the need of having to keep us with the latest articles, open source projects, or talks people are talking about. Moreover the feeling of having to craft a thought-provoking piece or software to craft people’s attention is fading away. That helps me have more focus on the things that I like doing, which in the context of software, it’s Tuist.
