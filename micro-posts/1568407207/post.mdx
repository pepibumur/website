I just came across three interesting Swift libraries that I might use at some point. The downside of the Swift Package Manager being decentralized is that is hard to find hidden gems through Github's gems:

- [Bouncer:](https://github.com/flintbox/Bouncer) A command line argument parser.
- [Work:](https://github.com/flintbox/Work)
  Execute shell command and get output. Simple and robust.
- [Motor:](https://github.com/flintbox/Motor)
  Swift cli spinner. Simple and fully customizable.
