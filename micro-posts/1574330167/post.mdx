These days's I'm working on using the technology mindfully to support my life goals instead of wasting my time, and most importantly attention, on things that don't help me pursue those goals. As I mentioned yesterday, I started by not wasting time catching up with the unceasing amount of activity that we find nowadays in the social networks and in particular, in our industry.
I feel more focused and energized and I'm funneling that into my passions, like Tuist.
