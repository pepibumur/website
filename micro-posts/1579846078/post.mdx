I just came across this [blog post](https://swiftrocks.com/reducing-ios-build-times-by-using-interface-targets.html) about the idea of interface targets to speed up builds in modular apps and I think it's an awesome idea. The setup is not easy to maintain but luckily, [Tuist](https://tuist.io) is there to help.
