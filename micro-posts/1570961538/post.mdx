One of the most bitter moments when I got very into the iOS community was realizing  that very admired community members completely refused to debate opinions other than theirs. Some even tried to hurt me when they perceived my opinions as a risk for the idolatry they had been working for years.

I decided to distance myself from such a toxic environment and now in hindsight I think it was a great decision. Now I can see all of it from outside.
