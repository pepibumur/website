I really miss having an iOS app to post entries in the website journal. Every time I do it, I have to create a folder in the repository with the unix timestamp as the name, a `post.mdx` file, add the content to it, and then commit and push the changes.

Although not very inconvenient, I'd like to be able to do it on the go. Pick up my phone, open an app, write what I want to share, and hit share. I did some groundwork to start building the app but I couldn't find time lately to work on it.
