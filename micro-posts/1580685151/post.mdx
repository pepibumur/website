The world would be so much better if we learned to value quality over quantity?
Speaking about our industry,
I keep seeing people and companies talking about success in terms of number of followers,
stars, visitors, podcast listeners, users, subscribers, customers, money, projects, side projects.
However, none of them talk about the impact that they are having on people's lives;
is it positive?
