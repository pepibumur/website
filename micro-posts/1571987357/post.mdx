I'm incredibly excited to start building Galaxy, a web app for Tuist projects that provides teams with insights that help them make informed decisions about the project structure. Just recently Apple announce a framework to collect metrics from your apps, which is great to optimize things in your apps, but what about projects? Teams don't know how many warnings their builds are throwing, the number of modules, the size of them... What if a developer introduced a regression  in build times, who is going to catch that on a PR unless there's a third-party element that keeps track of that information, compares, and alerts you if something is very bad.
