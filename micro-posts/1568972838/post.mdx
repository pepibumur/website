I'm working on the generation and distribution of a design system's icons to iOS and Android apps.
This not-so-difficult task showed me a core difference between the Android and iOS build systems:

- **iOS:** The inputs of its build process are static: x sources and y resources will be used and they need to be part of the target. As a consquence, I got a lot of pushback from iOS developers that disagreed with having all the icons as part of their project target. _Why am I having all those icons if I'm not using then?_

- **Android:** Conversely, Gradle is more dynamic and supports manipulating the build elements along the process. That makes it possible to shrink unused resources by just setting a flag to true. There was no pushback in this platform because developers trust the build system on doing its job.

And all of that made me think about Tuist,
which brings some dynamism to the iOS ecosystem by generating the project dynamically.
