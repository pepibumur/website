First day in Tokyo and here are my impresions:

- The city is extremely clean, modern, and well organized.
- You can feel the harmony in its population and the city.
- People are exceptionally polite and respectful.
- They are not good at English but they'll do their best to understand you.
- It's a paradise for tech geeks like me to get lost.
