It feels so great being in control of the content that I produce and decide on how I'd like it to be presented on my website. I'm considering adding a gallery section akin to Instagram to share photos taken from my phone.

But before that, I'd like to build an app to write and share posts. Right now I'm writing this from an iOS Git client and the process is not very straightforward.
