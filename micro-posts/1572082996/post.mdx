Just as a note to self, the following one-line Docker command is very useful to build/test Swift packages in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    --volume "$(pwd):/package" \
    --workdir "/package" \
    swift:5.1 \
    /bin/bash -c \
    "swift package fetch && swift test --build-path ./.build/linux"
```
