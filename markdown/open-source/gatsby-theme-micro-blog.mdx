This project is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) theme to add microblogging to an existing Gatsby website. It defines a convention for the structure of the posts, and provides a React component, `<Timeline/>` that can be injected anywhere on the website.

It supports customizing the component used to render each post.
