Indie Social is a specification for the structure and format social content, and the configuration of statically generated websites.
I started writing it up motivated to encourage people to be owners of their social content on the Internet,
stripping all the features that are inspired by the attention economy that we are used to on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter.

Having a specification allows building clients for publishing content, as well as plugins for existing static website generators.
