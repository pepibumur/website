This project was inspired by [this project](https://github.com/Shopify/cli-ui) that some colleagues developed at Shopify. 

Acho allows developers to define prompts on their command line tools. With a simple interface, you can pass a list of items to the library and it'll present an interactive picker on the standard output from which the user can select one option.
