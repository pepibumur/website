I continue to be excited about Tuist.
It's one of those things that brings me a lot of joy when I work on it.
What makes me the most exciting is the challenge of abstracting Xcode intricacies that arise when Xcode projects grow.
I relate Tuist to Rails,
a framework that I had the experience to learn and fall in love with very recently.
Rails provides beautiful and simple abstractions for most of the features that are required nowadays to build web apps.
**What Tuist's abstractions will look like** is still to be defined,
but I'm glad that we are on the right track to define them.
