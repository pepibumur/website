title: Building mental models
tags: ["buildify", "open-source"]

As you probably know,
I started building [Buildify](https://github.com/buildifydev),
an open-source and AGPL-3-based tool for deployments.
Like I did with [Tuist](https://tuist.io),
I'm in the process of building mental models around the business domain.
It's one of the hardest steps,
and the most important one for the viability of the project.
If those models are not solid enough the application might become unusable,
and if it's not flexible enough it might limit the development of future features.

As I keep thinking about the problem, some ideas are starting to emerge.
For example, providers like [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com),
offer a serverless solution for containarized apps.
In other words, you can provide them with your Rails application in a Docker image and they'll take care of scaling the resources are needed.
This simplifies things a lot on our side because we are mostly responsible for building deployable artifact that can then be handed over to the cloud provider.
For long-running services those deployable artifacts will be Docker images.
In the case of lambda functions and static websites it'll be a tar file containing the HTML, JS, and CSS following a conventional structure.
And for mobile apps, it'll be the Android App Bundle or app archive without signing.
The signing will be done server-side.
