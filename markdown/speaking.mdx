# Speaking

I love conferences and meetups, they’re a great way to share what we’re working on, learn from like-minded folk, and meet new friends.

If you think I might be a good fit for speaking at your event, please drop me [an email](mailto:pedro@ppinera.es), I’d love to hear from you. My talks are easy-to-understand introductions to privacy, ethical design, and accessibility/inclusive design. They are usually designed for a wide audience of people in the web and tech industry, but can contain more technical detail or more accessible explanations to better suit the background of the audience. I’m very friendly to non-technical audiences, and try to practice accessibility and inclusivity in everything I do.
