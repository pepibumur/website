# Speaking

I love conferences and meetups, they’re a great way to share what we’re working on, learn from like-minded folk, and meet new friends.

If you think I might be a good fit for speaking at your event, please drop me [an email](mailto:pedro@ppinera.es), I’d love to hear from you. I like to talk about building developer experiences, tools, and how to scale up iOS projects.
