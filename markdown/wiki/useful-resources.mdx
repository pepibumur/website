## Continuous integration

- [macadmin-scripts](https://github.com/munki/macadmin-scripts): It contains a script to build images with a macOS installer.

## Command line tools

- [xcdiff](https://github.com/bloomberg/xcdiff): xcdiff is an extensible tool that finds differences between two .xcodeproj project files. It can be thought of as git diff for .xcodeproj files, which can be used directly from the command line as well as a library supporting your own set of tools.
- [isign](https://github.com/saucelabs/isign): Code sign iOS applications, without proprietary Apple software or hardware.

## Applications

- [Pock](https://github.com/pigigaldi/Pock): Display macOS Dock in Touch Bar. It's free and open source!
