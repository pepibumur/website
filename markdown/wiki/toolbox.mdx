- [**Spotify:**](https://www.spotify.com) I can't imagine using my laptop without listening to music. I'm a huge Spotify fan. I have years of listened music in my profile and I don't see a change of service anytime soon.
- [**Cleanshot:**](https://getcleanshot.com) I use this tool to take screenshots and record videos in my laptop. What I like from the tool compared to the system's native feature is that I can blur part of the content easily.
- [**Rocket**](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/): Mind-blowing emoji on your Mac.
- [**Caffeine**](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/): Caffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar.
- [**SIP**](https://sipapp.io): A better way to collect, organize & share your colors.
