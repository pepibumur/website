## Developer productivity

- [Scaling teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyr0C40_DUY): As organizations scale, more developers join the team. More developers make it increasingly difficult to enforce code styles, follow best practices, and document mistakes that were made without relying on word of mouth. While we have tools to check some stylistic components, we lack tooling to document issues and best practices. This talk focuses on strategies and solutions, particularly around best practices, that we employ to help educate and accelerate nearly a thousand developers, without getting in their way, by providing them information “just in time”.
