My role as Product Design Lead is figuring out our high level product design vision, advancing our design processes, working on our internal style guide, growing the team, and ensuring everyone is happy and productive. When I’m lucky, I get to work on design projects. What’s not included in my job description is making sure that subtasks on a certain project are on schedule.
